My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7702522816">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
 This was an excellent introduction to the disc from a world building perspective, but to be completely honest I struggled to get through it at some points. It is quite obviously a satirical comedy, but suffers a bit due to over committing to the bit, in my opinion. Because everything is so wacky, and generally having the piss taken out of it, I found myself struggling to care. I found most of the characters quite unlikable, largely because they are mocked too much throughout the story. As the reader I think you shy away from these characters because if you relate to them then you must also be kind of an idiot and no-one likes to be called an idiot.<br /><br />I found myself enjoying the book the further through I got, the jokes started to hit harder and the characters became slightly more grounded. I adore the joke about the hydrophobic wizards, it is funny in so many different ways, and was my personal highlight. I understand why it isn't recommended to start with <i>The Colour of Magic</i> but it is by no means a bad read. I would not recommend it as a standalone book, but I would as part of the series.<br /><br />To summarise; I have no strong feelings about this book, read it or don't â€” you'll probably be happy either way.

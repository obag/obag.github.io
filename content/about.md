Some old friends of mine once gave me the nickname "O-Bag". I thought it was a terrible nickname and cringed every time I heard it.

I have written a lot of terrible work throughout my life that makes me cringe every time I read it. I recently started to write again, and I figured that adopting the alias "obag" was fitting.

This blog is a space for me to post my writing, good or bad, so that I can get over my fear of having other people read my work. I figure that if I can publish my bad writing that makes me cringe under an alias, maybe one day I'll have the guts to publish my good writing that makes me proud under my real name.

I do not post content of any particular niche, on this blog you will find opinion pieces, creative writing, semi-academic essays, book reviews, recipes, partially true stories, and so on. I hope you find yourself some entertainment on this site.

If you want to chat about anything I have written here please flick me an email at obag.blog@pm.me. Please don't pull any punches if you want to criticize my writing... this is my space to improve as a writer not to stroke my fragile ego.

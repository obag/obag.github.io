I used to have some friends who would try and invent slang. We had some terrible nicknames for each other, and I managed to score "Obag". I hated it. Several years later I decided I would start writing again, and adopted obag as my online alias.

I created this blog to get over my fear of publishing my work. Some of what I write is actually very good, but I am still very hesitant to show people. A lot of what I write is very bad, but I feel it is important to huck it out there too.

If I can bring myself to post bad writing online under an alias, maybe I'll get to the point where I can publish my good writing under my real name.

If anything I have written is worthy of conversation to you, please contact me at owainscribbles@proton.me.

Thanks for your time, I appreciate it.

OOF! AAHHH\u0026rdquo; broke your train of thought? You were probably thinking about that hot girl who ignores your sorry ass all the time, bitch. Not that it matters what you are thinking I really don\u0026rsquo;t care.\nDo you know what I do care about? Yeah probably the same thing you do at this very moment. Oh actually no not that. That is fucking disgusting. Okay, lets take a step back.\nAhem\nSo anyway, you are crossing a river. Well, to be more exact you just crossed a little bridge. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t really a river, more of a creek. And you hear a wet, slapping, sound, and some froggy moans. Kind of like the noises you heard from upstairs in your moms room the other night. You should get a job. You\u0026rsquo;re thirty-fucking-two for Christs sake. So, (UNLIKE THE OTHER NIGHT HA HA) you feel the need to investigate these noises. So you look up from your dirty phone screen and actually pay attention to your surroundings for once. Oh whats that? You\u0026rsquo;re lost?\nNo shit dickhead. It is a miracle you\u0026rsquo;ve lived this long, incompetence of this degree is subtly impressive if I am being honest. So as we find you at this moment, you have just looked at your surroundings, realised you have crossed a bridge that you have never seen before, and are lost. And you keep hearing moist, sexual, slapping noises around you, followed by a ribbity kind of grunt.\nI should clarify \u0026mdash; these aren\u0026rsquo;t actually sexual sounding noises at all. You just have 32 years of sexual incompetence and frustration culminating in your slight arousal at the sound of a pained frog. You can\u0026rsquo;t make this shit up. Unbelievable.\nSo you investigate the noise. A whimpering, unmanly noise escapes your unshaven face, the sound waves themselves repulsed by the halitosis years of neglect produces. \u0026ldquo;h-h-h-ello-ooh..?\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;YO WHAT\u0026rsquo;S GOOD?\u0026rdquo; the rocks and trees reply.\nYou are too much of a coward to reply. Obviously. Fucks sake. Why do I always get the shit ones. Upstairs they have fucking Beowulf and I have Carl The Virgin Who Fears Frogs. If I wasn\u0026rsquo;t literally chained to this typewriter, I would crawl out of this pit and beat you to death with a sockful of breath mints.\nNo way. You actually ran off? A disembodied voice from the creek (yes, creek! I was writing river but then I realised that was too conceptually vast for your shrimp brain to comprehend) scared you so much you actually ran. I suppose that is a pretty big deal for you given that you haven\u0026rsquo;t outpaced a tortoise since you were seven years old and tied to the back of a ute. Fuck why couldn\u0026rsquo;t I have had that story? At least its funny. You\u0026rsquo;d expect this story to be funny, given that it is about an upside down frog who keeps landing on his head and saying \u0026ldquo;OUCH! My little froggy head!\u0026rdquo; Unfortunately, Carl With The Charisma Of A Dead And Rotting Rat is really killing the vibe.\nOh my god you call that running. Please stop! There is a cliff there! Just talk to the FUCKING FROG!\nOh well.\nHave you ever walked down the street and crossed a river when the pained sound of an upside down frog hopping onto his head and saying \u0026ldquo;Ouch! My little froggy head is so sore!\u0026rdquo; drove you into such a panic that you literally ran off a cliff, fell 57 metres and died on impact?\nHave you ever had a silly little frog who keeps landing on his head because he hops around but is always upside down miss his opportunity to be in a fun little short story because you are so impressively hopeless?\nHave you ever gone unburied for 7 weeks and eaten by seabirds as a strange and goofy upside down frog lives his short and peculiar life without ever being noticed by a brave hero who begins the quest for a little froggy helmet for his sore little froggy head?\nThe end.\nPS: If you publish this filth I will swallow every key on this typewriter and suffer internal blockage very loudly and annoyingly until you buy me a new typewriter and then I will swallow the keys on that typewriter and then whine even more obnoxiously and keep on whining until the end of time itself.\n","date":"30 May, 2025","id":1,"permalink":"/posts/the-strange-case-of-the-upside-down-frog/","summary":"Have you ever walked down the street, and crossed a river when the sound of schlop shclop splat \u0026ldquo;OUCH!

Le Guin My rating: 5 of 5 stars\nI read this book for the first time when I was quite young. Mum had bought The Earthsea Quartet and told me I absolutely had to read it. I was not so keen, she had recently made me read some really boring historical fiction, and this looked to be a slow, thoughtful book about a wizard. Who even wants to read about wizards? They don’t fight in battles, they just sit around pondering. How is that going to make a good book?\nWe were going on holiday, and I ended up taking the book with me, to humour my mother, and also because I had read all my other books. I had no intention of reading it, anyway. Obviously, the weather went ape shit, and the whole family aside from me got the flu. I found myself in a cold little cabin, with nothing to do but listen to my family complain, and read a boring book in my sleeping bag.\nI read all four books, cover to cover, in a weekend. I was so disappointed there were only four. I remember the sheepish realisation that those were the best books I had ever read. I was obsessed with sword fighting and knights and battles, but I had been absolutely blindsided by a philosophical tale of a teenage wizard mastering his own mind.\nA Wizard of Earthsea was written for teenagers, but does this lovely thing where it trusts them to read and understand the book themselves. It isn’t a difficult read, by any means, but neither is it oversimplified. I think I got more out of it when I was a pre teen, but it held up excellently as I revisited it in my 20s.\nIn Le Guins own words:\n“Despite what some adults seem to think, teenagers are fully human.”\nThe tale of Ged told in this first book is a classic. It is the tale of a young man letting his ego take hold and unleashing evil into the world. Only by accepting his imperfections is he able to overcome the evil, and continue down the path to wisdom.\nThe world of Earthsea is a perfect fantasy setting. I can’t get enough of it. It is so grounded, it has your standard fantasy tropes of magic, dragons, etc., but at the same time it is a humble world occupied by fishermen and huts. It doesn’t need much explaining, and doesn’t try to be anything it doesn’t need to be.\nI was hoping to capture the impact this book had on me in a short review but I am not a capable enough writer to do that. All I can say is that I am going to make sure that my kids give this book a read, grudging or otherwise.

I can highly recommend it, and I really enjoyed the prose of Severian/Wolfe.\nLooking at the work as a whole, I cant be sure that I actually like it. The divide between how men and women behave in this story is jarring. There is an argument to be made that this is just how Severian interprets the world (and he is not exactly the pinnacle of morality). I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel this aspect of the book is largely contamination from the time it was written, and Wolfes own background and viewpoints, rather than a deliberate storytelling device.\nI suspect that a lot of the themes underlying the book were lost on me as I do not have a religious background. I found myself confused on several occasions at what the meaning of certain imagery was, but I suspect it would add much more depth to more educated people.\nRegardless, I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

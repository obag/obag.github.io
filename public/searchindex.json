[{"content":"The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett My rating: 3 of 5 stars\nThis was an excellent introduction to the disc from a world building perspective, but to be completely honest I struggled to get through it at some points. It is quite obviously a satirical comedy, but suffers a bit due to over committing to the bit, in my opinion. Because everything is so wacky, and generally having the piss taken out of it, I found myself struggling to care. I found most of the characters quite unlikable, largely because they are mocked too much throughout the story. As the reader I think you shy away from these characters because if you relate to them then you must also be kind of an idiot and no-one likes to be called an idiot.\nI found myself enjoying the book the further through I got, the jokes started to hit harder and the characters became slightly more grounded. I adore the joke about the hydrophobic wizards, it is funny in so many different ways, and was my personal highlight. I understand why it isn\u0026rsquo;t recommended to start with The Colour of Magic but it is by no means a bad read. I would not recommend it as a standalone book, but I would as part of the series.\nTo summarise; I have no strong feelings about this book, read it or don\u0026rsquo;t — you\u0026rsquo;ll probably be happy either way.

Le Guin My rating: 5 of 5 stars\nI read this book for the first time when I was quite young. Mum had bought The Earthsea Quartet and told me I absolutely had to read it. I was not so keen, she had recently made me read some really boring historical fiction, and this looked to be a slow, thoughtful book about a wizard. Who even wants to read about wizards? They don’t fight in battles, they just sit around pondering. How is that going to make a good book?\nWe were going on holiday, and I ended up taking the book with me, to humour my mother, and also because I had read all my other books. I had no intention of reading it, anyway. Obviously, the weather went ape shit, and the whole family aside from me got the flu. I found myself in a cold little cabin, with nothing to do but listen to my family complain, and read a boring book in my sleeping bag.\nI read all four books, cover to cover, in a weekend. I was so disappointed there were only four. I remember the sheepish realisation that those were the best books I had ever read. I was obsessed with sword fighting and knights and battles, but I had been absolutely blindsided by a philosophical tale of a teenage wizard mastering his own mind.\nA Wizard of Earthsea was written for teenagers, but does this lovely thing where it trusts them to read and understand the book themselves. It isn’t a difficult read, by any means, but neither is it oversimplified. I think I got more out of it when I was a pre teen, but it held up excellently as I revisited it in my 20s.\nIn Le Guins own words:\n“Despite what some adults seem to think, teenagers are fully human.”\nThe tale of Ged told in this first book is a classic. It is the tale of a young man letting his ego take hold and unleashing evil into the world. Only by accepting his imperfections is he able to overcome the evil, and continue down the path to wisdom.\nThe world of Earthsea is a perfect fantasy setting. I can’t get enough of it. It is so grounded, it has your standard fantasy tropes of magic, dragons, etc., but at the same time it is a humble world occupied by fishermen and huts. It doesn’t need much explaining, and doesn’t try to be anything it doesn’t need to be.\nI was hoping to capture the impact this book had on me in a short review but I am not a capable enough writer to do that. All I can say is that I am going to make sure that my kids give this book a read, grudging or otherwise.

I can highly recommend it, and I really enjoyed the prose of Severian/Wolfe.\nLooking at the work as a whole, I cant be sure that I actually like it. The divide between how men and women behave in this story is jarring. There is an argument to be made that this is just how Severian interprets the world (and he is not exactly the pinnacle of morality). I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel this aspect of the book is largely contamination from the time it was written, and Wolfes own background and viewpoints, rather than a deliberate storytelling device.\nI suspect that a lot of the themes underlying the book were lost on me as I do not have a religious background. I found myself confused on several occasions at what the meaning of certain imagery was, but I suspect it would add much more depth to more educated people.\nRegardless, I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
